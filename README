NAME
    EWS::Client - Microsoft Exchange Web Services Client

VERSION
    version 1.113000

SYNOPSIS
    Set up your Exchange Web Services client.

     use EWS::Client;
     use DateTime;
 
     my $ews = EWS::Client->new({
         server      => 'exchangeserver.example.com',
         username    => 'oliver',
         password    => 's3krit', # or set in $ENV{EWS_PASS}
     });

    Then perform operations on the Exchange server:

     my $entries = $ews->calendar->retrieve({
         start => DateTime->now(),
         end   => DateTime->now->add( months => 1 ),
     });
 
     print "I retrieved ". $entries->count ." items\n";
 
     while ($entries->has_next) {
         print $entries->next->Subject, "\n";
     }
 
     my $contacts = $ews->contacts->retrieve;

DESCRIPTION
    This module acts as a client to the Microsoft Exchange Web Services API.
    From here you can access calendar and contact entries in a nicely
    abstracted fashion. Query results are generally available in an iterator
    and convenience methods exist to access the properties of each entry.

AUTHENTICATION
    Depending on the configuration of the Microsoft Exchange server, you can
    use either HTTP Basic Access Auth, or NTLM Negotiated Auth, from this
    module. The default is HTTP Basic Access Auth, so if using NTLM, the
    following additional option to "new()" is required:

     use_negotiated_auth => 1,

METHODS
  EWS::Client->new( \%arguments )
    Instantiates a new EWS client. There won't be any connection to the
    server until you call one of the calendar or contacts retrieval methods.

    "server" => Fully Qualified Domain Name (required)
        The host name of the Exchange server to which the module should
        connect.

    "username" => String (required)
        The account username under which the module will connect to
        Exchange.

        For Basic Access Auth this value will be URI encoded by the module,
        meaning you don't have to worry about escaping any special
        characters. For NTLM Negotiated Auth, pass a "user@domain" format
        username and it will automatically be converted into Windows'
        "domain\user" format for you.

    "password" => String OR via $ENV{EWS_PASS} (required)
        The password of the account under which the module will connect to
        Exchange.

        For Basic Access Auth this value will be URI encoded by the module.
        You can also provide the password via the "EWS_PASS" environment
        variable.

    "use_negotiated_auth" => True or False value
        The module will assume you wish to use HTTP Basic Access Auth, in
        which case you should enable that in your Exchange server. However
        for negotiated methods such as NTLM set this to a True value.

    "schema_path" => String (optional)
        A folder on your file system which contains the WSDL and two further
        Schema files (messages, and types) which describe the Exchange 2007
        Web Services SOAP API. They are shipped with this module so your
        providing this is optional.

    "server_version" => String (optional)
        In each request to the server is specified the API version we expect
        to use. By default this is set to "Exchange2007_SP1" but you have
        the opportunity to set it to "Exchange2007" if you wish using this
        option.

  $ews->calendar()
    Retrieves the EWS::Client::Calendar object which allows search and
    retrieval of calendar entries and their various properties. See that
    linked manual page for more details.

  $ews->contacts()
    Retrieves the EWS::Client::Contacts object which allows retrieval of
    contact entries and their telephone numbers. See that linked manual page
    for more details.

KNOWN ISSUES
    *   No handling of time zone information, sorry.

    *   The "SOAPAction" Header might be wrong for Exchange 2010.

THANKS
    To Greg Shaw for sending patches for NTLM Authentication support and
    User Impersonation.
